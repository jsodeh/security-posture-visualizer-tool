## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

#### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
src/
├── components/dashboard/    # Business logic components
├── components/ui/          # Reusable UI components
├── services/              # API and business logic
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
└── types/                 # TypeScript definitions
```

#### Database Design
```sql
-- Multi-tenant architecture with proper relationships
organizations (1) → (many) assets
assets (1) → (many) vulnerabilities
organizations (1) → (many) risk_scores
organizations (1) → (many) pentest_findings
```

#### Security Implementation
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Multi-tenant data isolation
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and type checking

### Key Algorithms Implemented

#### 1. Risk Score Calculation
```typescript
// Weighted risk assessment algorithm
const overallScore = Math.round(
  (attackSurfaceScore * 0.3) + 
  (vulnerabilityScore * 0.4) + 
  (pentestScore * 0.3)
);

// Attack surface scoring based on asset exposure
const attackSurfaceScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, 100 - avgExposure));

// Vulnerability scoring with severity weighting
const weightedScore = (critical * 10) + (high * 5) + (medium * 2) + (low * 1);
```

#### 2. Penetration Test Grading
```typescript
// Letter grade calculation for pentest results
function calculatePentestGrade(critical: number, high: number, medium: number, low: number): string {
  const totalFindings = critical + high + medium + low;
  const weightedScore = (critical * 10) + (high * 5) + (medium * 2) + (low * 1);
  const percentage = ((totalFindings * 10 - weightedScore) / (totalFindings * 10)) * 100;
  
  if (percentage >= 95) return 'A+';
  if (percentage >= 90) return 'A';
  // ... additional grade thresholds
}
```

#### 3. Data Ingestion Processing
```typescript
// XML parsing for security scan files
private static async processNmapXML(content: string): Promise<ProcessedData> {
  const parser = new DOMParser();
  const doc = parser.parseFromString(content, 'text/xml');
  
  // Extract hosts, ports, services, and vulnerabilities
  const hosts = doc.querySelectorAll('host');
  // Process each host and create asset records
}
```
